## The numbers

> 1.9 * 1.9 * 1.92 * 1.9 * 2 * 1.78 * 1.9 * 1.88 = 167.46
8 way combi of independent events

> 1/167.46 = 0.0059
**1 in 167 or 0.6% chance, if the odds would be 100% fair i.e: the person selling it to you would make 0 profit**

But in reality the vig (overround) on every bet is compounded in the bookies favour.
In this case it just happens to be on some niche markets... Throw-ins, tackles? Really?! Who bets on that?
The fish who don't understand these niche markets have even lower liquidity and a even higher overround.

On a good day, the vig on every leg could be 5% (likely higher in reality)

> 1.05^8 = 1.47

By this simple trick. The vig goes from 5% to 47%. 
This is how the bookies gets rich quick.
